## 🚀 About Me
I'm a CompSci student mostly focused on backend technologies.

Started out in middle and high school with the basics of C, Java and web technologies, then focused on embedded programming and PLC in college.

Worked as a PLC programmer for about 5 months, but decided to return to software engineering,
 as it usually allows more creative work and is way more rewarding for me personally.


## Current projects
👩‍💻 I'm currently working on a web API and a web application for a project, which aims to 
create a working model of a high-end elevator with RFID permission verification and
 travel history.

🧠 I'm currently learning .NET and Entity Framework.
